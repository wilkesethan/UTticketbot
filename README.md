# UTticketbot

Hi! I was bored one day and decided to make this bot. This is intended to be able to pull tickets from the UT student claim page. This bot will NOT help you claim a ticket when they initially drop, but it can get a ticket with near 100% certainty after the ticket claim initially happens. Students are able to return their claimed ticket if they decide to not use it and it will go to the first person that checks out on the student claim page.

Here is an explanation on using this bot:

You will need to download and set up an application called “9Hits”. Here is a link: https://9hits.com/ 

Copy the link to the UT claim page and put it at the top of 9hits in the link box. Here is an image of what that should look like:

After this, you will need to copy and paste the javascript file into the code section.

You simply will press run and sign into the UT ticket page. It will continuously attempt to claim a ticket. Once a ticket is claimed, you will have to manually follow the steps to check out. The ticket will then be in your account.
